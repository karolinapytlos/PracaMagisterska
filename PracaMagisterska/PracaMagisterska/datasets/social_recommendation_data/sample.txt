we had a crack in the shelve upon delivery and got that resolved after much persistance then the ice maker broke down twice within the first year and had that replaced twice now the ice machine can hardly produce enough ice for fairly light use 2 people especially when we use it more than 1 time each if you have a greater demand on a hot day or have company over you will run out of ice completely often the ice maker has a hard time with the crushed ice feature or the ice cubes simply get stuck up in the machine and you will need to open it up and manually push the ice cubes down so they can be dispensed	1.0
i had to unpack it to get it throughthe front door and the first thing i noticed was that it has a clip to hold the electric cord out of the way when it is on the appliance trucka small item but a testament to the consumer orientation the led light is a bright white i emptied a full side by side into the new refrigerator and still had room to spare a few of my taller door items in the old frige had to go in the ample space created with the fold away self	5.0
the ge advantium is much more than a microwave uses halogen lamps microwaves ceramic and coils to heat the food from above and below to cook at up to four times faster than a typical oven at first my wife was concerned that she wouldnt be able to figure out how to use it but there was no need to figure out how to program since the speedcook menus guide you through over 175 different type of foods under headings of breads breakfast chicken potatoes seafood desserts meats snacks pizza and sandwiches now she loves it and we were able to free up limited counter space by getting rid of our counter top convection toaster oven	5.0
i was remodeling my kitchen about a year agoand needed an inwall microwave my wife had been asking for two stoves for the one day a year we need them so i decided to spend the extra money and get the advantium in addition to a standard range i thought i would use it as a microwave and as an oven on thanksgiving boy was i wrong it came with a dvd showing the many things it could perform and how it uses a mixture of different types of heating in preprogrammed formulas it demonstrated some of the dishes they had me at grilled cheese sandwiches i ran in and made one possibly the best i have ever had i then proceeded to gain too much weight sampling what it could do the chicken cutlets were moist in the middle but crispy on the outside taking much less time to cook those frozen hash browns you get at costcowonderful i wound up buying a small microwave because we do 90 of our cooking in the advantium its a real where have you been all my life item	5.0
this is one of the most overpriced overhyped appliances i have ever bought my wife and i built a new home and moved in at the end of 2006 and we outfitted the kitchen with ge profile appliances we wanted both a microwave and 2nd oven a salesman pitched this oven to us as a microwave and 2nd oven combinedwhich would supposedly reduce the number of appliances we would have to put into the kitchen which was important to us not as much for cost savings on the appliances but because the kitchen has limited space for appliances it turns out to be just a really expensive microwave the oven functions do not work that well in my experience it is supposed to cook food faster by using a combination of convection and microwave the resulting quality of the food is nowhere near a regular oven the user interface is easy but very cumbersome you have to go through way too many steps just to do a simple time cook and the worst part for us is that the oven broke two weeks after the oneyear warranty expired to add insult to injury the folks in customer relations at ge were rude and apathetic	1.0
i feel that i should start out stating that the entire titanium series is more for older children and adults than for small kids i say this because the various toys are a combination of die cast metal and plastic that often have sharp points this being said i grew up with such toys that probably had lead in them even and i am pretty much ok end of safety rant	5.0

jaw harp juice harp jews harp mouth harp ozark harp all of these names refer to one of the oldest musical instruments in the world often seen as a novelty here in the usa it still enjoys worldwide popularity in its many forms as a cultural instrument i had one of these snoopy jaw harps when i was a kid and enjoyed messing around with it a few weeks ago i saw one in a military surplus store i bought it for six bucks mostly out of a case of nostalgia im glad i did because ive had a ton of fun with it since then	5.0
i bought this truck used back in 2003 ive always been a chevy man but this truck changed that in a heartbeat the engine reliability the 30l engine has always had the power to do whatever i ask its not quite as powerful as the 40l but its reliability and endurance have earned the 30l the nickname cockroach ive beat on it pretty hard and so far its lived up to its name cold weather starts have been no problem and ive had no stumbling my one complaint is that when im running it hard at 4000 rpm it pings slightly with regular unleaded i started using the medium grade gasoline and the problem hasnt returned the engine power engine power is lacking a little but still enough to chirp the tires at take off or do an allout burnout the 150hp claims are at the crank and not the rear wheels its been estimated that rearwheel power is about 123hp you can improve this by installing an aftermarket underdrive pulley these pulleys run about 70 and free up some power from the accessories for the rear wheels ive also invested in a programmer to tune the engine and give another 10rwhp i have the 373 gearing which gets really good gas mileage the sticker says 22mpg but id estimate at closer to 19mpg if you want to do a lot of towing or want faster take offs id suggest 410 gears taller gearing basically makes your rpm a little higher at lower speeds since the 30ls power really kicks in at 3500 this means youre able to transfer more power to the road earlier in your take offs im satisfied with it as i said before it has always done what i asked from passing to pulling ability ive never been stuck with a 2wd youd expect to get stuck every once in a while but this truck has never let me down ive never done any extreme offroading but i did drive after a fresh 9 of snow fall everyone around me was getting stuck including a 4wd chevy silverado the chevy was stuck on an offramp that had not been plowed along with a snow plow i was able to take another unplowed snowcovered exit that was not only long but also up hill it slowed me down but couldnt bring my then stock ranger down i was also able to escape my unplowed driveway and punch through the 3 foot drift onto the street handling ride quality the ranger is definitely a sport truck you can take corners fast and beat most other vehicles off the line at red lights there is no play in the steering adding to the feeling that youre very much in control of where that truck is going and how fast its going to get there the ride is about as good as it gets for a truck you have to sacrifice a little ride quality for hauling capacity so dont expect it to feel like a car the stiffer suspension makes the little bumps bigger but it also makes the big bumps seam smaller what i mean is that i often take rough railroad tracks at about the same speed i take the smoother ones with very little change in the ride quality its fun to drive and in driving it you can tell that its a quality vehicle craftsmanship they arent kidding when they say built ford tough this truck feels like its indestructible and for most drivers it is ive driven through bumpy fields at 30mph ive punched through 5 foot snow drifts coated in ice and ive hit railroad tracks fast enough to go airborne i didnt realize those tracks were so steep nothing has every broken when it comes to making a truck thats tough as nails ford knows what theyre doing im not encouraging you to drive recklessly but if you have a history of beating up your vehicles this truck can take the punishment comfort im 6 4so i was a little worried about a smaller truck at first but after driving the ranger i found that there is plenty of room granted i have the seat all the way back but there is plenty of space for my head and legs i have bucket seats in mine with a middle seat ive had two other guys in the truck with me and while it was close its wasnt uncomfortable for the hour long drive the extended cab is also nice for carrying tools or my two dogs the fold down jumper seats seem a bit small for anyone of above average build i dont know that anyone but a child or a person with a petite build would be comfortable back there the bucket seats are a bit uncomfortable for drives lasting more than two or three hours if youre just doing a quick commute you probably wont notice summary i love my truck its modifiable safe capable and sexy i wouldnt trade it for anything	5.0
the thing about this truck is that you will find great deals almost anywhere you look the truck is reliable and just a smart buy it is a very comfortable ride and it fits 5 people with ease i bought the edge model and it is a very good truck easy to clean and looks great when modified i have had absolutely zero problems with it in over a year of owning i own a manual and the shifting is very smooth seats in the back are fold down and very comfortable for passengers i have only good things to say about this truck	5.0
the first half of 2001 has been a season of dramatic change in the mkp51 household as our family settles into our home in midcoast maine for the long haul after traveling around the world for the better part of a quartercentury weve steadily been replacing our old worn out or outdated belongings with newer more attractive and longer lasting items a few examples in january we replaced our ancient tattered sofa easy chair and recliner which we had carried with us across europe throughout the 1990s with a new living room set on march 9th i replaced my glacial hewlettpackard pavilion computer with a new compaq presario 11 gig screamer on april 26th we bid adieu to our 1991 honda accord lx and replaced it with a 2001 ford zx2 our faithful honda a veteran of four military changes of station and with more miles on it from europe than the us is now in the hands of our oldest daughter finally came the turn of my constant companion for the past two and a half years my bright blue 1999 ford ranger sniffsniff i always develop an emotional attachment to my vehicles a wonderful vehicle as i pointed out in one of my earliest reviews got us through two winters and 31500 troublefree miles always eager to serve in whatever capacity i required only over the past few months as our family became more active and my demands on my truck increased i began to realize that my 99 ranger was proving itself less adequate for my needs so with great reluctance i decided that the time was ripe for a gulp trade two weeks ago with a tinge of sadness i bid my 99 ranger a fond farewell and surrendered it to the dealer from which i had originally bought it in its place i welcomed into our family a new friend a 2001 ford ranger xlt supercab toreador red a bigger engine more space in the cab even room for passengers back there behind the 6040 split bench seats most important more power more comfort good fuel economy everything i need from a pickup truck in this rural area in which i live the 2001 ford ranger xlt supercab boasts an impressive list of features so what did i get for my money 30 liter v6 engine with electronic fuel injection 5speed manual transmission with overdrive two wheel drive rear wheels driven power steeringbrakes 4wheel antilock brakes front discrear drum extended cab with two door design 6040 split bench seats each independently adjustable air conditioning passive antitheft system solar tint glass spare tire lock amfm stereo radio with single compact disc player here are my initial impressions of this impressive vehicle now that ive had the opportunity to drive my new ranger for a couple weeks powertrain the 30l v6 engine is excellent brawny and eager to accept whatever challenges i give it whereas my 99 rangers 25l fourbanger had some trouble climbing the fairly substantial hills in our area the 2001 supercab does not my new red ranger gets over those hills quickly even in 5th gear theres even room for me to accelerate on hills while in overdrive the engine is silky smooth and barely audible even at high speeds the only times i can hear the engines faint growl is when im shifting through the gears this is a tribute to both the engine and the trucks ergonomics more about that later the engine is pretty fuel efficient for a v6 the trucks window sticker says im supposed to get 22 miles per gallon highway and 17 miles per gallon combined highwaycity driving so far over the past two weeks ive been doing slightly better 235 mpg highway and 193 mpg combined like its predecessor the 2001 supercabs 5speed manual overdrive transmission shines shifting action is very precise theres almost no slop in the floor mounted shifting lever i always have the safe and sure feel of being securely locked in whatever gear i desire handling the 2001 ranger supercab handles very well indeed the suspension is stiffer than most compact pickups so the ride isnt the same as youd expect from a car with its longer wheelbase than models with the regular cab theres quite a bit less bouncing around on rough surfaces power steering is pinpoint accurate the vehicle goes exactly where you point it with almost no lean or body roll the fourwheel antilock brakes are muscular and quick to respond theres no sidetoside pull at all one annoying feature of the antilock brakes pointed out in the owners manual as normal operation youre likely to experience a small amount of brake shudder when braking hard on wet or slippery roads ive already discovered the truth of this warning a couple of times during recent rain storms ergonomics my new red rangers extended cab is the primary reason why i bought the vehicle and its already proven its worth several times the cab is spacious with about an extra 12 inches of room behind the seats thats plenty of room to store my backpack and lunch box when commuting to work groceries and other merchandise when shopping or my guitar and music books when going off to church in addition my wife son and i can now ride comfortably for short and medium distances without crowding each other you gain access to the rear area by sliding the front seats forward getting into the back isnt exactly easy even with the 6040 split bench seats all the way forward the opening to the rear area is very narrow once there however passengers can ride in comfort at least for short distances because the jump seats in back are mounted to the side walls of the cab theres plenty of leg room for both passengers i do wonder about those ittybitty sidefacing jump seats though are they really as safe as front facing seats would be speaking of leg room in the 2001 ranger supercab heres an area of vast improvement for the driver and all front seat passengers front seat occupants can now recline their seat backs and move the seats far enough back to realllyy stretch out the gas brake and clutch pedals are well positioned for maximum comfort one small but very significant ergonomic improvement over my 99 ranger the size and location of the tiedowns in the truck bed gone are those teensy ubolts inconveniently crammed into the farthest reaches of each corner of the box directly under the bed rails in my red ranger theyve been replaced with much larger and sturdier rings theyre still located in each corner but now theyre closer to midway between the bed rails and and the floor even with my bed liner installed i can get to the tiedowns very easily with ropes or bungee cords controls and instrumentation as with rangers in past model years controls and the instrument cluster are very well designed everything is large easy to see and well within reach the 2001 supercab adds a tachometer to an already excellent instrument panel that accompanies a large speedometer and fuel temperature battery and oil pressure gauges as well as the usual host of idiot lights the interior is whisperquiet much more so than my 1999 model even at highway speeds theres barely a trace of road rumble or wind the environmental system heaterdefrosterair conditioner is excellent the air conditioner keeps the cab nice and cool on hot days without turning the interior into a refrigerator it does a good job of removing interior fog off the windows it usually takes less than a minute to clear all windows the large rotary knobs that control the environmental system are simple to operate and controls are reasonably well placed below the radiocd player i must note however that the knobs are slightly less convenient in trucks with the 5speed manual transmission with its floor mounted shifting lever the 4speaker stereo amfm single compact disc cd player is very good ther radio comes with standard features digital display seek scan and presets for am and fm stations the audio quality from both the radio and the cd player is good for an automotive system all audio frequencies bass midrange and treble are crisp loud and clear although the bass frequencies seem a bit boomy to my ears a sound compression button similar to a loudness control on home stereo systems helps keep the music clearly audible even at highway speeds the audio system controls are large and easy to read my 2001 ranger comes with a passive antitheft system the trucks keys are electronically coded to operate only in my vehicle when i turn the engine off the antitheft system automatically arms itself a red light flashes on the instrument panel indicating the system is active if anyone attempts to start the truck without its specially coded key the antitheft system disables the engine and transmission reliability if the track record of my 99 ranger is any indication i dont foresee any trouble at all with my new vehicle i had only one problem with my old ranger and that was quickly disposed of under warranty by my dealers service department ford covers its new vehicles with an excellent 3 year 36000 mile warranty this time i opted for fords 5 year 75000 mile extended warranty it covers all repairs with a 50 deductible for the life of the contract of course the regular warranty picks up all costs during the first three years the extended warranty also gives me free oil changes for the life of the contract general observations as with every ford pickup truck ive ever driven i find the 2001 ranger supercab to be superbly built it has a solid durable feel to it and there are no squeaks or rattles or other annoying little defects to contend with one special note my 2001 ford ranger came equipped with firestone wilderness at tires the exact tires recalled by ford on may 22 2001 ford motor company has authorized the free replacement of these tires no questions asked just as soon as my dealer gets its shipment of 15inch tires from goodyear over the long run im sure that my 2001 ford ranger supercab will turn out to be excellent for my needs like my 99 ranger it will prove excellent for general cargo hauling yard work and other aroundthehouse chores so welcome to the family red ranger ill be relying heavily on you every day to get me to work and to help keep things running smoothly around the ol homestead im absolutely confident that you will excel at every task i give you	5.0
recently i bought a 2001 ford ranger xlt 4x4 offroad 40liter v6 with the stepsidebed it was slightly used with 23000 miles as a college student i owned a 2003 bought in 2002 ford focus zx3 of which i loved for its gas mileage and handling anyways like i said i traded that in for a truck knowing i would need it for my temporary construction job and when building my new house i was a little weary of the 40 knowing that i would suffer budgetwise for gas mileage as i estimated i did suffer about 14 mpg difference bw my car normal for a truck thus far i am more than pleased with the trucks power reliability style i love the new grill and allaround performance i ended up with 16 mpg overall not too shabby the singlemost impressive thing that i have experienced with this truck is its fourwheeldrive system i currently have a hobby vehicle a 1989 ford bronco ii xlt 4x4 that has a godawful amount of miles on it but hey its a ford this oldbeater may not be easy on the eyes or ears or nose 231k will do this to a car but the four wheel drive is like nothing else it will literally climb a tree with the studded snow tires i put on it for winter the 2001 ranger follows this tradition uncannily well with a 4x4 system that i think outdoes any other my best friend has a tacoma trd the fourwheeldrive sucks dont believe what you see on commercials i would recommend this truck solely on its 4wheeldrive but that aint all the ranger has the interior is about what one would expect from a truck pretty mundane as my bronco ii was i dont know why everyone is complaining about the ranger common complaints seem to be roominess seat comfort and fitandfinish as i said its a compact truck what would you expect an interior like an escalade pickup this luxury stuff is really starting to annoy me the seats have excellent support the jumpseats are small but again what would you expect my 3 backpacking cronies pile in the truck fine for 3 hour trips and they dont complain i think its time we all got a little tougher about things like that the compactdisc player and the speakers sound great together though they dont boom like the focuss blaupunkt setup but they are good enough especially since the cab is small one would not need much more than it offers road noise in the cab is somewhat identifiable a steady engine hum accounts for this but i was glad to hear it just to be able to hear if anything might be wrong my sisters new durango is incredibly quiet and that isnt a good thing seeing as though she couldnt hear some major engine defects that eventually were pretty big problems road noise can be minimalized with different tires my ranger has bf goodrich allterrains on it they aid the already sturdy chassy in sticking to the road studded snow tires work well on the truck and like the bronco ii it will go anywhere with them the seat material is rugged and will probably hold up for a very long time the plastic dash pieces aint cheap and instruments are laid out simply and logically there are more innercab vibrations with the 4 door than the two door but despite the 4 doors vibrations in the cab are minimal reliability is a big issue these days auto prices are increasing and therefore even terribly unreliable vehicles have to compete in some way and raise their prices if thats what the market asks of them be careful when searching for a truck believe me after 2 toyotas 1 nissan 1 isuzu 2 gms and 3 fords i know the rangers reliability is overall amazing minor defects are or should be expected after all the machines we make arent perfect why because we arent in the first place major defects in the ranger are usually caused by poor care be especially careful when buying used trucks make sure and purchase a warranty if this is the case or its just a dud this happens even for mercedes in all my ford encounters problems were usually my fault or the previous owners plus fords are incredibly cheap to fix in comparison to its competitors the engine hmm lets get to the point its really fast for a compact truck let me say that again its really fast for a compact truck handling while not even close the the zx3s is exceptional this is even true while on dirt or gravel roads steering is pretty tight but it has to feel like a truck on some level not a car we shouldnt be complaining about that around town and on windy western north carolina roads the truck does excellent it handles turns with minimal body roll thats something that cant be said for its competitors especially the s10 and sonoma the stiff suspension in the offroad package is excellent despite its occasional bang on potholes etc my father has a 2001 xlt 4x2 and to tell you the truth the suspension on the 4x4 is much more suitable not as bouncy all in all i am more than pleased with my purchase the major downfall if you can call 16 mpg in a truck a downfall is gas mileage but the power is much needed in a truck so i dont care so much it has done at least a third of the work for building my new house whether hauling off the garbage and scrap wood or bringing the wood and materials home my bright blue ranger has this far done everything ive requested of it if you are looking at a ford understand this one portion of my review do not ever talk bad about it if you do it will treat you badly in my theory fords do have a personality it can be your best friend or worst enemy i know sounds stupid right take a look at the bad reviews for the ranger or any ford for that matter they are written by people who are too critical of their vehicles thats what they get in return a bad transmission karma to sum it all up with the 2001 ford ranger you cant go wrong in my opinion the ranger outdoes all of its competitors on every aspect think about it this way if you purchase one you are furthering fords technological advancements in the not too distant future it is likely that ford will be the only company that will build the perfect truck	5.0
after 11 years with my old nissan truck it was time to renew i was looking for an americanmade compact truck with more room conveniences power than i had before i shopped around the used truck market but finally decided to buy a new 2001 2wd ranger supercab with the 40 v6 208 hp 5sp auto in this configuration ford laid out the truck with 4 doors cruise tilt air dual media stereo single cd cassette with 4 speakers electric mirrors windows electric locks with remote 4 wheel abs and chrome wheels i bought the truck in toreador red with a grey interior i did not like the tan interior at all too bright do you want to burn rubber the more powerful 40 v6 208 hp is chock full of power torque it is fast from a red light and can change speeds on the highway quickly it might get me a ticket lol i planned on towing my motorcycle trailer 3000 lbs loaded and the truck is more than capable of that according to the books it can tow 5700 lbs the truck is prewired with a flat 4 connector but you got to buy the reese style receiver and stopping is not a problem with the fat tires 4wheel abs ford did pretty well on their interior gages are easy to read controls are within reach the heater controls are very elementarythe manual does not need to be consulted to operate i have three personal interior gripes the radio buttons though large easy to read could have been more logically arranged the front seat cup holder center console is a far reach located on the floor and the seats could use more adjustments or something to make them more comfortable for the long haul please consider the first two gripes minorpicky but the seats do need some redesign as far as ride it is good for a compact truck it handles the bumps nicely at slow fast speeds there is some wind noise at highway speeds i attribute it to the whole side of the cab being doors i like the fact that you sit high even though it is a 2 wheel drive truck it gives you a better view of the road plus you can see over some of the traffic ahead of you ford continues to manufacture a market leader this is a good solid compact truck i recommend it	5.0
i love it my truck has a great look and definitely turns heads i trade in a 95 ford explorer sport 4x4 i have to tell you that i already miss the full back seat my two daughters like riding in the back but i can tell the novelty will soon wear off the explorer had more power and the turning radius was much better however at 83000 miles the gas mileage was horrible i went to the dealership with the intention of buying a new ford explorer however the 30 sticker sent me looking for something cheaper i looked at the new sport and sport track but like its big sister the price with options put it near 30k too much for a car in my opinion i immediatly noticed the truck on the showroom floor it looked very tough and extremely sporty be advised i am a 36 yo white collar professionalnot an 18 yo looking to buy his first truck the salesman was steering me toward the new escapeyuk the escape is boring inside and out i kept going back to the ranger after a long solo test drive i was sold the wind noise is average the nissan i test drove was much worse take offs from traffic lights are more than adequate the internal controls are easy to reach and attractive i opted for the 6disc in dash cd player it reacts a little to slow for my taste but the sound is clearit makes highway driving fun i play music loud and cannot hear anything going on outside the truck i especially like the way ford increased the rangers height it sits at the same level as the explorer overall i recommend the ranger extended cab 4x4 40 v6 it handles well and does great off road the stylish improvements and interior do a great justice to this truck if you are in the market for a small suv or pick up try this out in your search you will not be disappointed it matched the foreign competition in every way except was typically 35000 thousand dollars cheaper good luck	5.0
i traded in my 1998 ford ranger 4x4 30l supercab for a 2001 ford ranger edge supercab 4x4 40l sohc i just love this truck i wanted a f150 but buget didnt alow that i settled on the ranger and im very happy with it i looks good runs great and will do just about anything the power is amazing for a v6 i pulled my dads 3500 lbs boat and it had no problem what so ever the soundsystem sounds great too the only problem i had was a camchain tensinor went bad at 32000 miles the truck was one day out of the used warrenty and the ford dealership didnt even help out with the 1100 cost to fix it ive been told that this was a problem for the sohc engine once fixed its as good as new im plannnig on keeping this truck untill it dies which means aftermarket stuff in the future i also had a 92 f150 4x4 and i like my new ranger better all in all i am very pleased with this truck	5.0
ive had my dc07 for two years now im sold on this machine and lemme tell ya im not an easy sell when it comes to newfangled appliances though a progressive kind of guy in most respects im an unreconstructed reactionary when it comes to household goods i like old stuff in other words im suspicious of molded plastic and i recoil from permanently lubricated motors folks there aint no such thing just motors engineered to seize up and die after a given period of time until recently when the pickings got too slim i did most of my appliance shopping in second hand stores and flea markets i have electric fans older than i am heck some are probably older than my parents im middle aged built before planned obsolescence was the gospel of manufacturers give me some industrialstrength heavy iron and a little 20weight oil and im happy	5.0
i admit i was skeptical when my husband said this was the vacuum for us hes quite a gadget person and i thought this was another gadgety gimmick i was kind of pleased with my old hoover even if it did clog up with pet hair from 2 dogs and 2 cats and broke belts at amazing speed i agreed to see a demo of the dyson and the beachbum looking australian the inventor i admit got me mildly interested i liked that it was bagless i liked flipping a switch to vacuum bare floors since we have a lot of hardwood in the house and i also admired the cool attachment bought separately that really works for picking up pet hair it attaches to the hose that pulls out of the front of the vacuum on furniture with a minimum hassle the styling is a cross between the jetsons raciness and functional scandinavian design in a bright inspirational yellow	5.0
i just had to add my rave reviews for the dyson animal vacuum cleaner when i adopted my dog last year i really needed a machine that would handle heavyduty shedding this one does	5.0
this is by far the best vacuum i have ever owned ive gone through several brands including rainbow and electrolux and they dont measure up i always tell people my vacuum can suck the drapes off at 20 paces it wouldnt shock me if that was true	5.0
the dyson company definitely uses truth in advertising this vacuum does everything its supposed to and that means it doesnt loose suction just as mr dyson will tell you himself on his commercials i decided to try out the vacuum as none of the others i had used seemed to be of very high quality it was a tossup between this and another very popular vacuum brand and i thought that the dyson would be much more of a workhorse boy was i right	5.0
my husband and i were going shopping prior to our anniversary and i talked him into footing the bill for the dyson animal vacuum at best buy when we got home i was really excited to try it even though i had just vacuumed with my old dirt devil the machine managed to pick up two canisters of stuff in our tiny apartment plus the carpet here is so old and flat i was impressed to see that it sucked hard enough to make vacuum lines in the carpet so cleaningwise this thing is great also the attachment wand to so convienient to use i have never used one even close to as much as i have since ive gotten this machine i love it another benefit is the construction everything is really easy to take apart and put back together when you need to clean it out and cleaning the filter is a cinch i really love this machine not to mention that it looks pretty cool too	5.0
a very freaky member once asked if people had ever sworn they had written a review on a product only to find that they hadnt i was recently looking for the review i wrote on my	5.0
my wife was attracted by the concept that dyson does not require a bag this part is true because the suction is so bad that it would not fill a bag if it had one dyson claims that it never loses suction this is true as wellbecausethe initial suction so so poor that it would be difficult for it to get worse the product is overly complicated and the carpet beater rotor has never worked for the price i could have got ten aquavacs which are not brilliant but they are vastly better than the dyson product my wife has just told me that she would like to burn her dyson but that would probably cause the fire brigade to be called outthe suction is bad the method of extending the wand is badly flawed in that the tube tries to retract only partially inhibiting what suction there is the carpet beatercleaner is a joke	1.0
in the past three years we have gone through three different expensive model vacuums hoover eureka and dirt devil all three died within a year of their purchase i had been looking at the dyson for a while but the price made me a little nervous granted 200 for a vacuum is one thing 500 is quite another i bit the bullet and bought one and have no regrets at all the vacuum is easy to use i totally love this purple machine i have a carpeted split stair case with a landing in the middle and none of the prior vacuums did well at cleaning the stairs in fact i had to get out the shop vac from the garage to really clean the stairs now with the dyson that shop vac stays where it belongs because the dyson is even better at cleaning the stairs i have two shelties and even with frequent brushing they drop undercoat everywhere and the dyson cleans it up without having to go over spots again and again its also the only vacuum i have purchased that actually does do bare floors instead of just blowing the dirt around to other areas on the floor a friend of ours also has one and she just raves about it as well bottom line the vacuum works even better than the advertisements boast its easy to use easy to clean and never having to buy replacement filters or bags or the like its a downright bargain at the price dont hesitate if you are considering buying one my carpets and floors have never been cleaner nor have they looked this good since the carpet was installed	5.0
the first time i ran this vac on my carpet my wife almost cried shed just had our second child the week prior to the dyson purchase in fact and her hormones have made her into a clean freak 2 weeks prior to that we had the carpets steam cleaned professionally within 10 square feet of vacuuming thats about 2 5 foot long sweeps very little the dysons bin was swirling with disgusting hair and dander i am overjoyed with how well this machine works i never would have even guessed there was that much nastiness in our carpeting and we vacuum every day id say it made our old vac seem silly and i dont use that word lightly thank you dyson	5.0
after another vaccum biting the dust i purchased the dyson my last vac was a hoover cannister it was not cheap and within one week of the warranty expiration it went belly up i am grateful for using my amex card with a built in extended warranty plan and they gladly refunded me my full purchase price	5.0
i wanted this vacuum cleaner as soon as i saw it advertised on tv i have an incredible amount of animals three dogs eight cats squirrel rabbit cockatoo cockatiel etc my own little zoothat needs a heavy duty hair sucking monster this machine does that and more	5.0
we had been pondering purchasing a dyson dc07 animal vacuum for several months we were drawn to it because of its statements of having so much more suction power at picking up animal hair the documentation states that the root cyclone technology uses 100000 g of centrifugal force in the cyclones to filter dust from the airflow efficiently so it doesnt clog and doesnt lose suction it also states that after just 10 ounces of dust other bag and bagless vacuums can lose up to half of their suction power when dust enters them they clog which restricts the airflow and reduces suction power the dyson animal has 270 air watts of suction power the next highest is a bag vacuum at 200 air watts	5.0
love it	5.0
this is a great vacuum not only is it a great piece of popart but it can suck up dog hair like no bodies business we had a eureka before and it would not even put a dent in the hair our dog left on the carpet	5.0
my dad was an old vacuum cleaner salesman for some years he sold electrolux door to door so vacuums kind of run in our family	5.0
this is the best vacuum ever period end of sentence i have converted at least 6 other people to buy one and they love it too dyson can i come work for you as a spokesperson	5.0
my husband and i first read about james dyson and his amazing vacuum cleaners in a washington post article a few months ago when we saw the yellow dyson for sale in a sears ad offering 1 year at 0 financing we didnt hesitatewe immediately left for the store to check this baby out	5.0
i purchased this vacuum almost a year ago and havent regretted the purchase once while it was more money than i have ever spent on one vacuum i read many reviews and talked to many people and decided to make the investment and havent looked back since i will likely never own another brand of vacuum since ive gone to dyson	5.0
i love being able to keep the vacuum at the bottom of the stairs and getting all the way up to the top step even the hallway floor using the hose	5.0
what is the big hooha over dyson vacuum cleaners huh it looks funny looks gaudy and looks more like a childs toy well to paraphrase the man who invented it james dyson when you go into a shop and see a row of vacuum cleaners they all look the same shiny brand new and look powerful then you see this brightly coloured thing at the end with dust and dirt in the box but if this vacuum cleaner has loads of dust and dirt pulled from a supposedly clean carpet then its got to work hasnt it and it is precisely this kind of lateral thinking which made this the product of the millennium	5.0
the dyson dc07 is a step ahead in vacuums and probably represents the future of vacuums the dc14 by comparison has a more convenient wand and a lower center of gravity but slightly less airflow the latest dyson the dc15 adds significant improvements to the brushroll which will aid in sand removal and in cleaning deep pile carpets	5.0
i purchased this vacuum because i thought it was the greatest things since sliced bread but i was wrong i thought buying a bagless was a great way to save money and i wouldnt have to buy bags anymore again i was wrong the filters are the expensive part they are way more expensive then buying bags there is a hepa filter under the dirt container that dyson says is a lifetime guess what that isnt true i didnt change my filter and it killed my motor then i was getting new carpet in my house and i found out not many carpet companies will warranty their carpet if a dyson is being used on it i guess it will tear up your carpet then i wanted to go and change the belt but the belt is attached to a clutch and that is a really expensive part and only a expert can intstall it the machine does ok in the first year but after that you will find a decline in your suction so these vacuums are only good for a couple of years and then they go there isnt much metal on these machines so plastic is everywhere and plastic tends to warp and break to get the attachment to work on this vacuum is a nightmare you have to pull out the hose and then flip the extension if you are in a hurry good luck another thing do not use these on hardwood floors my suggestion is to try one out on your hardwood floor without turning it on and you can hear it scratching your floor especially with the plastic wheels	1.0
well we went with the expensive model for the new house and the this thing really works well i had canisters full of dust bunnies from the new carpet the suction on this vaccuum is the best ive ever used and it is very easy to assemble and use it took me about 15 minutes to assemble i returned the first on due to a faulty latch which caused a huge loss in suction the replacement model has been working like a champ for the past 5 months when the canister is empty you can see the whirlwind action sucking up anything and everything once the canister begins filling up the whirlwind action stopsnot because it stopped working but because dust and dirk and junk is actually being vaccuumed up into the canister cleanup is a breeze one simple latch to release the canister from the apparatus and another simple latch to open the trap door which releases all of the collected junk amazing performance on the down sidethe vaccuum is heavy i can lug it around no problem but my wife has trouble carrying it up the stairs of our 2 story house it has a pretty handy little handle which makes carrying pretty simple but the weight is on the heavy side what do you expect for such high quality no parts have broken yet suction is just as strong as when we first used it it is sturdy and well designed however forget about negotiating tight corners or small spaces you need to use the telescoping attachment for those jobs i for one am too lazy to do that also one other bad thingthe ac cord extension does not stay wrapped around the vaccuum i dont know how to describe it even when you have enough slack the back and forth motion of vaccumming caused the entire length of the cord to unwrap that is pretty annoying	5.0
i had been reading some good reviews on the dyson vacuums at first though i thought way too pricey but i kept hearing good comments my poor old panasonic was literally falling apart a 200 vacuum lasts us about 4 years so i reasoned what if i paid more and got one to last twice as long i really wouldnt be out anything	5.0
i bought a dyson about a year ago after going through other bagless vacuums like water other machines never worked as well as when i first used them also the other machines would clog endlessly and even overheat and stop working	5.0
my wife and i own a 3100 square foot home and the majority of the rooms are carpeted we also have 2 labrador retrievers one yellow and one black that shed pretty much all year long in addition we have 2 very active teenage boys and their friends that track in and out of the house each day needless to say our carpets get a real work out	5.0
this vacuum is truly an animal i got it switched it on vacuumed our 3 rooms and took the fur equivalent of our small cat out of the canister and this after first vacuuming with the old miele i had nearly every day i could not believe my eyes what came off my floors with this dyson it is an unbelievably effective machine no other vacuum i ever owned was this thorough its also fairly light and not too loud i love it	5.0
after managing to break yet another bagless vacuum my husband suggested that we purchase the dyson animal i was initially skeptical because of the price tag but he was convinced the dyson would be a wonder vacuum	5.0
i bought the dyson about 5 years ago when i was living in a townhome i thought that 500 dollars for a vacuum was way too much but i read the reviews on epinions and the dyson seemed to have the fewest complaints i had always promised myself that id write a review for it since the others i read were so useful now 5 years later i have to admit it has lived up to its billing and im finally getting around to writing the review mostly because im researching washing machines my townhome had thick plush carpet the home my wife two kids and two cats now live in has hardwood floors the dyson has worked well on both i have frequently washed the filters and they continue to function so the claim that you dont have to buy replacement filters is true it indeed has never lost suction friends have asked if id recommend it and my comment is always the same if you can afford 500 for a vacuum still seems like too much to me for a vacuum then its a great product the attachments did take some getting used to but after awhile i figured out how to manipulate them all and i can switch between vacuuming the floor and using the crevice tool in the corners in very short order i was pleasantly surprised that i could extend the hose and using the upholstery attachment clean all 14 stairs while the main unit sits at the bottom i have owned eurekas and dirt devils in the past and none of them has performed so well over such a long period of time again if you can get past the price tag the vacuum should not let you down	5.0
simply the best vacuum engineered to date we have four cats and i am amazed out how much hair is cleaned up with so little effort if you have many pets or kids it is worth every penny it is also surprisingly quiet compared to other high amp brands i purchased a factory reconditioned one and you wouldnt know the difference if they didnt tell you	5.0
let me begin by saying my wife is a vacuholic if vacuums had odometers we would have high mileage machines dont get me wrong i appreciate her focus on keeping the home clean but man have we been through some vacuums in our 10 years of marriage first a 49 dirt devil then a handmedown electrolux upright and most recently a bissell have proven to be no match for my little home keeper	5.0
now this is what a vacuum should be ive lived for years with the fact that most vacuum cleaners that i could afford simply could not remove all of the dog hair and dander from my carpets so i steam cleaned regularly with a rental industrial unit no longer with the dyson ill be steam cleaning a lot less	5.0
boy this has got to be the very best vacuum i have ever owned obsessa was right	5.0
a great vacuum for all surfaces	5.0
the first time i used a dyson i was visiting my parents somehow i found myself cleaning i got into places that my parents hadnt been in to clean for more than 10 years not to mention the presence of a long haired dog contributing to the stuff in the corners i was total amazed	5.0
i love this vacuum i have two dogs and this thing rocks i read many reviews before purchasing it and it was well worth the money spent it has a long cord which is great for not having to stop and move the cord to different outlets i can take it up the stairs in my home with just the one hose and not have to drag the entire vacuum i was unsure how the use of attachments would be considering everything is packed right on the vacuum i have had no problems i have had the dyson well over a year now and i am just as happy with it today as i was when i first bought it	5.0
this is actually our very first real vacuum purchase so we dont have much to compare it with but weve had this one for two years and i can tell you how its going	5.0
who would have thought there could be such a difference in how you view the lowly task of vacuuming	5.0
things that i love about this machine	5.0
i have had the dyson dc07 animal for over 5 years now it still has amazing suction my husband uses it in the garage and basement for dustparticle clean up and then back in the house on the carpets no change in the suction	5.0
i consulted many different sources including this site before buying our dc07 dyson aka the purple princess in my house i was ambivalent about spending so much money on a vacuum cleaner but as my son started crawling it became very evident that our older hoover just wasnt going to cut it despite vacuuming several times a week my son would have dog hair stuck to his still drooling mouth wet hands and clothing and our son began picking up little items off the floor andas young children will dothey went directly into his mouth	5.0
for a long time i had a hard time justifying spending 500 on a vacuum i hate vacuuming i was spending 100150 on my vacuums and replacing them every 153 years my last vacuum was a eureka and i actually had this one repaired once before it just stopped working i had just moved into a new home with carpet that other people had donedropped who knows what on and i have cats and my eureka was dead i needed a new vacuum i finally bought the dyson animal i figured that 500 with a guarantee to never lose suction was bettercheaper than the money i was spending each year to fix and replace cheap vacuums i had read reviews on the dyson and many people said that they could not believe the stuff that was in the canister after they vacuumed i could not wait to see what would be in my canister i was a little skeptical but after i vacuumed once i could not believe the cat hair dirt and other yuck that came out of my seemingly clean carpet i love vacuuming now the vacuum is very very light weight easy to push easy to carry updown stairs it comes with attachments for underneath low furniture and for on top of furniture it has a telescoping hose that can reach very far so that i can vacuum all the way up my stairs with the attachments and leave the vacuum at the bottom of the stairs it is very easy to put ontake off and use the attachments the vacuum is bagless and has a canister that with the push of a button comes off the vacuum and then with the push of another vacuum the bottom opens for easy emptying of the canister you can change the settings for carpet or bare floors i actually vacuum my kitchen linoleum rather than sweep and you wouldnt believe the hairfuzzcat fur that comes off of freshly moppedswept linoleum i use the attachments on my furniture i honestly cannot believe the difference this vacuum makes my carpet looks newer the color is better and the fibers are not as matted down the carpet feels better it is not as flat and hard feeling every time i vacuum i am appalled at the amount of stuff that my other vacuums were apparently leaving behind this vacuum is a big investment but you will be very happy with it i will actually end up saving money with this one because it is guaranteed to never lose suction so i wont be replacing it every 153 years like i had been before i figure if this one lasts even five years it will have been cheaper than buying a cheap crappy vacuum every 3 years try it and i dont think you will be disappointed this coming from someone who is so cheap that i cannot think of anything i would be willing to spend 500 on lol	5.0
i bought one of these dysons from costco about four months ago after reading some mixed reviews here on epinions	5.0
we decided to spend the extra money and get a dyson after several other vacuums had died this vacuum vastly outperforms all of the others we have tried and has lasted almost three times as long almost four years with no signs of stopping anytime soon	5.0
this vacuum may have been an investment on my sears card but it was worth every penny carpets are so filthy and i was so sick and tired of cheap vacuums that would spit dust back out the vacuums that did water filtration or foam or steam cleaning were all too heavy and too high maintenance to operate that is more time than i want to spend vacuuming a carpet i had stanley steemer come in and clean my carpets and purchased the dyson and am living clean it picks up cat fuzz that is left when a neighbors cat dashes in and hangs out for a treat emptying is a breeze with a trigger in the handle and dropdown bottom lid if you are concerned about escaping dust you can place a plastic grocery bag over the bottom or just put the the base of the canister above the can and pull the trigger the bottom drops out but remains intact with a hinge on one side of the very lightweight clear canister and the contents slide into the bag i like the clear canister because i can see when i need to empty it unlike bags and enclosed cleaning containers this guy thought of everythingi love it	5.0
after reading lots of comments on epinions and amazon i decided to buy the animal ive only had it a short time but there seem to be immediate results in terms of allergy relief i live with 5 birds not allergic to them and one shorthaired cat highly allergic there is also major construction going on in the house next door that shares a wall with our house our house is always dirty now from the construction dust	5.0
i received this as a christmas gift i love it the dyson dc07 is so easy for me to operate which says a lot for a person who despises vacuuming it is very powerful it picks up everything in its path on hardwood floors as well as carpeting	5.0
i was a bit skeptical of purchasing a dyson because it is higher priced than other vacuums but i finally broke down and made the purchase i have never regretted that decision i have now had the vacuum for four years and i actually dont mind vacuuming because i can visibly see the results i cannot believe how much dirt is in the canister after vacuuming the house the size of the canister is fairly large but i have to empty the canister frequently because the vacuum picks up so much dirt	5.0
i bought this vac 3 years ago as a floor demo model and i have never had a regret	5.0
for years i have had your average vacuum cleaner a handmedown right out of college a cheap model when my husband and i first got married and realized that vacuuming would be necessary so when we recently moved and recarpeted the our house we were vacuuming several times a week to get rid of the initial fuzz balls our cheap vacuum cleaner was getting clogged every single time my frustration sparked something in my husbands brain and he started looking at dysons he hit me up at the right time because i was so mad at our current vacuum cleaner that i would have said yes to buying anything	5.0
yes the title could be misleading but i have to say that after 1 year and going strong im still impressed i always hesitate writing reviews too soon and i feel one year is ample time to give a complete thorough review	5.0
works fantastic easiest vacuum to empty hands down and no mess its amazing how fast it fills up so you can imagine how many bags youll be saving you can empty it in seconds and do it all with one hand it can make old matted carpet look almost new i was amazed the first time i used it and ill never use anything else i love how i can in the middle of cleaning the floors quickly pull out the attached hose and suck up something in an odd place then immediately go back to floors without missing a beat back and fourth in seconds whatever you need its ready to go its that simple my mom complains that it isnt self propelled personally i always hated that feature so it doesnt bother me one bit but for her she likes self propelled vacuums the other complaint i have is that the switch for carpetfloors is a little stiff and in a hard to get to place would be better at the back of the vacuum easier to get to people talk about how expensive it is its not expensive when compared to something like a ridiculous 3500 kirby and it works just as good the end	5.0
with all its power you expect it to sound like a bulldozer but its quiet quieter than my previous panasonic	5.0
i hated using the vacuum before because i always felt like the floor was never truly clean i had bought a bagless and we had two other vacuums that used bags and all of them seemed pretty weak in the suction field one was even a 200 hoover	5.0
with seven animals 3 dogs 4 cats we needed a good vacuum i had been using an oreck saw the ad for the dyson and started my research thank you to the people who gave honest opinions on this siteyou helped me finalize my decision	5.0
i purchased this three years ago and i still love it not having to worry about if you have any bags left in the closet or an extra belt somewhere is a nice thing no bags no belts and on the rare occasion you have a clog its easy to find and clear it i like the onboard attachments and the telescoping handle absolutely the only problem i have had is the small attachment came apart so ill need to replace it otherwise i love it in hindsight however i would probably opt for the model that sits down lower for getting under furniture but the suction is great as evidenced by the amount of dirt you see in your canister every time you use it it really is worth the money	5.0
i am a woman five six and 135 pounds and i find this vacuum very difficult to use it is quite heavy over twenty pounds and is hard to maneuver you really can only push it straight forward and straight back the wheels could be on a small golf cart i could imagine this being used in industrial settings someone just pushing it over a floor with no furniture and just rawwwing back and forth but in a home with furniture it is quite cumbersome	1.0
i purchased this vacuum a few years ago and have found it to be every bit worth every penny it cost when i first got this vacuum home i wanted to do a little test of my own and see how much dirt i was really missing with my old dirt devil vacuum cleaner i lived in a 1000 square foot apt and vacuumed with my dirt devil and immediately vacuumed with my dyson to my surprise the dyson easily filled up a whole canister of dirt that i had missed i knew then that i had made the right choice by switching to a dyson i will never own anything other than a dysonim hooked	5.0
i grew up with using a kirby as a kid so i bought one myself in my early twenties and hated it i hated it when i was little so i have no idea why i would have thought i would like it now once i used the dyson i discovered a vacuum cleaner isnt just any vacuum cleaner anymore	5.0
i cannot say enough about this vacuumit really sucks in a great way i bought this product after my sister told me that her sons allergy doctor highly recommended it he has severe asthma and allergies	5.0
this thing is great i am a veterinarian so i own quite a few pets in all shapes and sizes let me tell you first hand if you own pets this thing gets the hair up with no problem hair that my other vacuum had been missing all this time came up and left the rooms cleaner smelling and obviously cleaner looking i was resigned to the fact that vacuums just cant pick everything up so i used to get my vacuum shampooed every six months well it doesnt look like itll need it that often after all this vacuum works and it works great	5.0
ive been reading so much about how great the dyson vacuum is that i just had to try it for myself i have a 1 12 year old and we are always on the carpet lying down on it rolling around on it and i want it to be as clean possible	5.0
i used to sell a vacuum from germany that was awesome i went into homes every day and compared the customers vacuums against the one i was selling and mine always outsucked theirs i was absolutely convinced i had the best vacuum in the world and i bought one for my own home	5.0
i was a little hesitant to see if this vacuum lived up to its name because of the price i decided to go for it and im so glad i did this vacuum is awesome ive got a black lab who sheds like crazy this vacuum picks the hair up with no problem the extension wand works wonders on the stairs and im absolutely amazed at how must dust and sand was living in the carpet cleaning the edges of the carpet isnt a problem either its like the thing works on magic emptying the basin is easy as well just one button and you dont even have to touch the dust	5.0
this vacuum is great i had just vacuumed my den before the old vacuum caught on fire and then filled up the dirt cup on just the den alone when i got this one it is so powerful you have to be careful of the blind cordsit will eat them if you are not careful doing the windowsills the dirt cup is so easy to empty and replace i love the beater brush for the stairs my only complaint is that the wand fits in the tube to vacuum so getting it out to do around the edges is a bit of a pain you have to plan ahead a little to make it not take forever but it is a small bit for such a nice vacuum	5.0
i just purchased my dyson animal and it is by far the best vacuum cleaner on the planet i have owned highend vacuum cleaners before but they all do and will lose suction and need frequent bag andor filter replacement i was extremely pleased with the functional design and was simply besides myself when i ran it for the first time it is the lamborghini of vacuum cleaners	5.0
there probably isnt much that i can say that other reviews havent already but i just had to comment on how ridiculously awesome this vacuum as you might notice i wrote a review only 4 short years ago on my previous vacuum a eureka whirlwind but that one bit the dust recently smoking up a storm for some reason i removed all i could from the roller so i dont know what happened instead of trying to get my old vacuum repaired i decided to bite the bullet and buy a dyson animal i was incredibly wary about spending upwards of 500 dollars on a vacuum but let me tell you it is worth every penny if not more	5.0
whats purple and gray sucks with its nose to the ground and eats bugs and anything up to 14 inch it can find not an anteater but the dyson dc07 animal	5.0
before buying this vacuum i wondered why anyone in their right mind would spend over 300 on a vacuum well after reading a few reviews from other owners i decided that i obviously didnt understand how much power varies between different vacuums	5.0
i desperately needed a vacuum that worked i really did i had a hoover upright that was so terrible that i had gotten to the point that there was no point in even turning it onit simply didnt work so i set out to research what i wanted in another upright it boiled down to a dyson animal my reasoning went something like this i have always had pets and they constantly shed and so if it cost more to get something to deal with this it would be worth the cost in aggravationor a miele they were both expensive but the miele was even more soand loud i ultimately decided on the dyson animal the next decision was whether or not i felt i needed the dc14 or if a dc7 would do i couldnt find enough difference to justify the 14 so all that remained was finding the best price which frankly was about the same no matter where i checked so i was right on the verge of purchasing at a local vacuum cleaner retail shop where i live because they would take the detestable hoover back as a tradein but the trade in was for very little they knew a dog when they saw oneand the price was still very high then i came across an ad for a factory reconditioned one at about 75 less plus another 50 rebatejust one catchinstead of a 2 year factory warranty i would only get a 6 month onethis brought the cost down to a very attractive priceattractive enough that i not only took the deal but also took out a 30 2 year extended warranty and with shipping i still came out great i have simply never ever owned a vacuum cleaner that did the job that this vacuum does my carpets look fantastic i also should mention that in addition to the incredible suction power of this vacuum and its ability to selflevel to the thickness and pile of the carpet a few of the small features really blew me away like the ability to get the working part under some pretty low furniture without even resorting to using the power wand or the beautifully engineered size that allows you to move this thing into and between areas that before i have always had to move around in order to vacuum or the little whiskers on the front corners that move debris out from the wall so it can be vacuumed up i even love the very long cord which keeps me from having to stop as often and change outlets oh another thingemptying the collection binall you do is simply hold it over the trash can pull what they call a trigger at the top the bottom swings aside and everything is dumped release the trigger and the bottom swings back in place and you snap it back on board and off you go believe me when you see what all this vacuum gets out of your carpets you will be really glad you dont have to touch iteeeoooowww it evens come with two products that will spot clean and deep clean your carpets even more than its incredible suction does the only problems that i had were very minor and had nothing to do with the ability or performance of the vacuum i had a problem comprehending how the wand fit into the hose during the minor assembly out of the carton and still dont feel that the manual was clear enough and the can of spot cleaner had shaken loose in the carton somehow which dislodged the cap and broke the sprayer rendering the spot cleaner unusable however i put in a call to dyson who had no problem sending me a replacement immediately i think dyson shouldve simply taped the cap on so that it couldnt come off even if the can did shake loose but thats really picking nits to complain about either of those problems when what i wanted was a vacuum cleaner that workedand boy did i get it	5.0
i had a dyson when i lived in the uk for 8 years but when i relocated back to the us the dyson brand was never heard of over here i couldnt wait until it arrived once it did the prices kind of kept me away	5.0
the dyson dc07 is the best vacuum cleaner i have ever used it sucks everything up as soon as you do one to two rolls over the mess i have the green and gold upright vacuum but it comes in an assortment of colors some of them being maroon and yellow silver and yellow and the green and blue just to name a few they are also extremely portable they are only a few feet high and pretty small width wise it cleans all floors weather it be carpet tile or wood not only does it clean floors but it cleans the stairs extremely easily the compact cord stretches all the way up the stairs this bagless vacuum fits in your closet really easily for easy storage because it is bagless it is really easy to throw away your mess all you do is open the cyclonic compartment take out the holder and dump it right into the garbage along with that feature there are also a few other brushes for easier vacuuming	5.0
ok i read all the reviews on here and actually went out and bought this vacuum based solely on the reviews i have to say they were spot on this is a perfect vacuum cleaner i love the extra long cord i only have to plug it in two different places to do the entire downstairs which is a great thing to me i have 3 dogs all of varying hair lengths and colors and 2 indoor cats so i have to vacuum every daytwice a day during shedding season mudtracking in seasongrass mowing seasonleaf falling season lets face i vacuum a lot	5.0
let me preface this quickly with a little side note vacuuming was one of my chores growing up i hated it i hated the noise the smell dragging around the canister replacing the bagyou name it when i got my first apartment i think i vacuumed it twice in the entire year i lived there then i got my dyson	5.0
though it rehashes other reviews let me take a couple of paragraphs to describe the machine dyson states that the purple plastic used to built the machine is the same stuff used in crash helmets i believe them	5.0
every time i take my own dyson out or spot one i feel compelled to do a demonstration for anyone nearby this vacuum is incredible and it proves its worth in black and white and other awful shades of dirt every time you use it if you thought you were picking up dirt before watch out	5.0
i live in a big house which holds two families mine and my grandparents so it needs to be vacuumed a lot the portion of the house i live in is almost 100 carpeted even the kitchen blah and therefore thats about the only way we can clean our floors the upstairs isnt much better	5.0
first of all i am the parent of 2 sons 3 cats 2 long hair and 1 dog i gave up on my hoover when we moved into my current house because it had carpeted stairs the vacuum was also 10 years old	1.0
one word wow i dont think i could be any more impressed with this vacuum if someone had given it to me and paid me to use it	5.0
i have had several vacs this one outdoes them all i would highly recommend this vac to family and friends i was amazed at the cleaning power i was surprised what my hoover windtunnel left behind dog hair no more with this vac	5.0
i bought this vacuum when my cat and i moved in with my catallergic boyfriend i use it at least once a week to vacuum up the cat hair and other dirt from my furniture and hardwood floors it works wonderfully and it is so satisfying to see everything you vacuum up in the clear canister id definitely recommend this vacuum	5.0
i first want to state that i have two dogs a little pug that sheds like there is no tomorrow and a neapolitan mastiff who also sheds but not as much trying to keep up with these boys is a chore in itself ok now to the dyson this is my first high end vacuum i had a hoover wind tunnel bagless previously so i was very skeptical in dropping down close to 500 for a vacuum but curiosity finally got me and so i did it out of the box the vacuum is a neat looking purple color very little assembly was required and i was off vacuuming the whole house i believe it did a good job in cleaning the carpets in all of the rooms the day before i vacuumed the family with our older vacuum and then went through it with the dyson and it picked up a lot of dirt not sure if it was due to the powerful suction power or just the light flickering out in my old hoover the vacuum was able to pick up all the doggie hairs with no problem i like the floor tool attachment i hate sweeping and this covers that with ease attaching the tools is relatively easy except i prefer attaching the tools to the end with no grip in the dyson commercials you see the guy attaching the tools to the handle end it works equally well on either end but just seems easier to have a nice handle to hold on to while you vacuum disposing of the dirt is easy just a pull on the trigger and its empty also 6 months maintenance is easy only one filter to clean overall im very happy with my purchase	5.0
ill start by saying we bought a new home with miles of new carpeting the old home was all wood flooring and a good vacuum wasnt on the top of my list of priorities	5.0
i bought this and after using it once i returned it its suction power is ok but at 400 i expect it to be great i noticed there were a couple of times where i had to vacuum over an area 45 times before it sucked up the debris my old vacuum did that and it only cost me 100 so for 400 i expect it to do better than my old vacuum	1.0
